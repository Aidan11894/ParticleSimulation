## Particle Simulation (Java)

This project will be mainly used as a means of learning various aspects of the Java language and using them in a way that is interesting (to me at least!).

As of now, I do not have a fully fleshed out idea of what this project will involve or in which direction I will go, if any, in the long term but in the short term I will implement a simulation of (classical) particles acting under the influence of various forces and eventually scaling up the number while optimising. If anyone happens to stumble upon this repo and are wel versed in Java, then comments and suggestions about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.

The rough checklist is as follows:\n

- [ ] Implement gravity
- [ ] Add Collisions
- [ ] Add damping
- [ ] Add charges to particles
- [ ] Using cursor to simulate force on screen
- [ ] Rigid bodies/springs?
- [ ] Implement in 3D
